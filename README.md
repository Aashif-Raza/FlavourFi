## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd Recipe-Finder-App
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Set up your API key:**
   - This app uses the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api). Get your free API key from their website.
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:
     ```env
     VITE_SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```
   - _Note: The current codebase has the API key hardcoded in several files. For better security, move the key to the `.env` file and update the code to use `import.meta.env.VITE_SPOONACULAR_API_KEY`._

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or as shown in your terminal).

## Usage
- Use the search bar to find recipes by keyword or ingredient.
- Apply filters for dietary needs, cooking time, and more.
- Click on a recipe card to view details, nutrition, and instructions.
- Save your favorite recipes for quick access later.
